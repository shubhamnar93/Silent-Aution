This is a Silent Auction program built as part of the 100 Days of Python course by Angela Yu. It simulates a silent auction where multiple participants can place secret bids. After all bids are submitted, the program reveals the highest bid and the winner. It demonstrates handling user input, dictionaries, and looping structures in Python.
1. Secret Bidding System: Each bidder enters their bid privately.
2. Highest Bid Detection: Automatically finds and displays the highest bid along with the winner's name.
3. Multiple Participants: Allows for any number of participants to enter their bids.
4. Simple User Interface: Users can continue submitting bids until they choose to stop.
5. Error Handling: Ensures valid input for names and bid amounts.
